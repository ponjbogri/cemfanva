<p>Communicating with Thieves</p>
<p>2010 Performance Video 4’54mi Lambda Print 1200mm x 1200mm</p>
<p>Selecting a number of banks around Helsinki Niwa projects onto their exterior walls, outside of ban opening times, the phrase “Thieves, now is the time to steal!”, using a large scale light projector. The act of trying to talk with anti-social characters such as thieves, through a building in which all bank staff are absent, is an act attempting communication with the “other” which latently exists within a collective. Those who saw the sign may not only imagine this to be an act of resistance against the banking system and capitalist society but may also call to mind the theft which happens at close proximity in everyday life. Produced in a residency at Helsinki International Artist Programme, Finland. Supported by HIAP</p>
