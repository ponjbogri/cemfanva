Taking from his house magazines and fruits previously purchased, Niwa wanders around the town buying the exact same products in various stores. Through this never ending loop of action an escape is found from the daily repetition of consumption and ownership. Within our economic system, we give no question as to how we may always lay our hands on various objects and where they might have come from, they are commercialized before us and transformed into economic value. Within the usual movement of economics it does not necessarily occur, but if someone has the will then they may achieve an opening of a structural gap in this system. What is it that we consume? What is it that we purchase?
