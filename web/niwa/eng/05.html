<p>Memories amongst Vegetables</p>
<p>2008 Performance Video 14â€™00min</p>
<p>Undertaking this project in Shanghai, Niwa gathers vegetables such as carrots, broccoli, onions which can easily be purchased in the area and with the cooperation of each audience member a series of commemorative photos were taken. Once returning to Japan the 36 frame film was developed and each photograph was made into a poster and sent by air mail back to each participant of the event. This project stems from the attempt to grasp at what form of relationship may be born from a single meeting. There is nothing unusual about such vegetables which are readily available, but this action proposes the possibility that such materials which can be found anywhere can also hold deep within them particular memories.</p>
