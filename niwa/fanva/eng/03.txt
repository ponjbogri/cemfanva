Going to San Francisco to dispose of my Garbage

Taking Japan’s rubbish to America. Taking his household rubbish Niwa boarded a plane to America and disposed of the waste at San Francisco’s rubbish depot. Crossing international borders while dealing with a local issue, this work offers a critique upon the relation between America and Japan, which socially and politically seem to hold such affinity with each other. The waste produced day by day: where does it come from and where does it go?
