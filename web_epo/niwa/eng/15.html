<p>Walking in the Opposite Direction of a Demonstration</p>
<p>2011 Performance Document Video 10’01 min, Video Still on Canvas 2600mm x 1450mm</p>
<p>Niwa joins a mass anti-nuclear demonstration in Shinjuku, walking from beginning to the end of the crowd in the opposite direction to their movement. As if this single man has no connection with the assertions of the protest, in the process of moving against the wave of people, this work captures people’s responses and expressions towards this. Through this action Niwa attempts to deconstruct the collective phenomenon of the demo to that of the level of individual participants. This work is created on the basis of the idea that in moving in the opposite direction of demonstration which upholds its own political message, a further protest parade may be created.</p>
