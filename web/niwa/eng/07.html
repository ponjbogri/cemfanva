<p>Make Tama Art University PIKAPIKAPIKAPIKA</p>
<p>2008 Performance Video 14’11min</p>
<p>For a period of 30 minutes the lights of the whole building of Tama Art University’s Ueno school building, including classrooms, offices, corridors, exterior lamps etc. were switched on and off every 5 seconds. Through the experience of working as a team with a great number of volunteers, Niwa attempted to give rise to a unique joy sharing in the moment of this flickering phenomenon. Finally ignoring the 5 second rule, a unique flicker of originality could be seen across the students’ classrooms. This was a project which realized a commonality between many different people through a shared fantasy.</p>
