Exchanging Between Turkish Lire and Euros in Istanbul Until There is Nothing Left 
2011 Performance Document Video 25’10min 
 
In a tourist area of Istanbul, visiting to a foreign currency exchanger close to the Grand Bazaar, Niwa undertakes to repeatedly exchange between Turkish Lire and Euros until all of his money has gone. While wondering around the area which is dotted with similar foreign exchange stores, Niwa passed his eye not to the many goods on the market, but merely repeated the act of exchange. This is a video document which pursues the meaningless loss of a traveler’s single life line, the cash one has in one’s wallet. This action points towards the position of Turkey, which has been at the crossroads between Asia and Europe, and the recent recession suffered in Europe by performing economic loss on an individual level.
