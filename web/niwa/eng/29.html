<p>Holding a Demonstration to the Peak of Mt Fuji from the Prime Minister’s Official residence</p>
<p>2012 Two Channel Video Installation (15’25min each)</p>
<p>Here Niwa, holding a large flag, joins one of the anti-nuclear demonstration held every Friday night in front of the Prime Minister’s Office, and then continues his march straight to the top of Mt. Fuji. As he marches on farther, the protesters gradually disappear, only to be replaced by tourists who surround Niwa as he reaches the top of Mt. Fuji after walking through the night. From the Prime Minister’s Office to Mt. Fuji, from protestors to tourists, can it be that there is some correlation between everything we encounter in the world around us? This work is produced with the sense of discomfort felt at the sudden dissipation of unity sensed in a demonstration once the appointed time has come to an end, creating a feeling similar to that walking back after a fireworks display.</p>
