Applauding Bears in Berne 

2011 Project Document Video 17’47min 
 
Gathering support of many local people this project offered up applause and praise to a bear in captivity in the city of Berne. This project questioned what could be said towards the bear which is a symbol of the city and a part of the psyche of citizens’ identity. Before the event itself Niwa undertook, through interviews, to research what thoughts local people hold towards the “bear”, the whole process being documented as a video. Here is an attempt to question to the bears what is it that we give rise to as a collective? As bears are unable to understand our language they give no reaction to this. It is this very situation which we must often face within our lives in our attempts of communication. Support: BONE Festival, Switzerland
