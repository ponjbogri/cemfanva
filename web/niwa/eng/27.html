<p>Holding a Demonstration to the Peak of Mt Fuji from the Prime Minister’s Official residence</p>
<p>2012 Inkjet Print on Cloth 1450mm x 2650mm, wood</p>
<p>An ink-jet print on large cloth of a still from the video. Through printing the image at a scale “larger than life” the image is degraded eliminating its photographic aesthetic and instead comes to emphasize the meaning of the action itself. Using the translucency of the cloth, the work was installed in the exhibition space with the shadow of the frame overlapping the image, while refraining from installing it off level. This shadow on the image seems to show the real horizon, though it is left deliberately ambiguous as to whether this is the horizon which was actually visible at the site of the performance or whether it is just the shadow of the frame, expressing the indeterminacy of the environment surrounding us.</p>
