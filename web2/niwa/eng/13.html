<p>Permitting Neon Sign</p>
<p>2010 Neon Tube 400mmx 600mm</p>
<p>Niwa requested the manufacture of a neon tube sign (usually used for advertising signs) based upon the hand written word “permit”. The result is a deviation from the usual commercial objective of such signs and without a particular meaning to the message, this sign raises the “action” itself, provoking the questioning of our relation to the other as we consider to whom and what do we permit? By the act of permitting something of others what impact does this have on oneself?</p>
