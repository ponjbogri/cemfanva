Reweaving Discarded Birds’ Nests on the Ceiling of the Gallery 

2010 Discarded Birds’ Nests, Camphor Trees, Earth, Ladder, Video 12’1min 
 
In this work birds’ nests which were removed or destroyed by local authorities as a pest control precaution were brought to the gallery and rewoven within the trees set in this space. This paradoxical action, in which we reconstruct the nests which we are usually trying to destroy, calls into question the necessity of humans from the perspective of animals who are unable to communicate with us. In the creation of a space where members of different communities, who are unable to translate between their respective languages, come together, these members must reflect upon their own role/existence in a means similar to a zen koan.
