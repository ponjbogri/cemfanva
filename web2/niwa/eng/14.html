<p>Tossing Socialists in the air in Romania</p>
<p>2010 Social Intervention Performance Video 29â€™09min</p>
<p>Taking Bucharest 20 years after revolution as its stage, this project entails tossing successors to the political members of the former socialist party into the air by the hands of the next generation who know little of the revolution. The process of negotiation with politicians and activists, who even now advocate socialism, was recorded as part of this work. In a country which has seen rapid economic progress, amongst a condition in which values are divided by the generations of before and after the revolution, Niwa brings these conflicting views to forcibly meet upon the rooftop of a building. The complexity of celebrating socialism and socialists, generally associated with a largely negative history, here Niwa raises the feelings towards a former system of society which can not be forgotten, and gives voice to the real words of general citizens towards politics. Support: Pavilion Unicredit, Romania</p>
