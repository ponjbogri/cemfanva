<p>A Pointless Group Photo of 76 People</p>
<p>2009 Lambda Print 530mm x 400mm</p>
<p>As a single traveler Niwa visited to a tourist spot of Toronto, CN Tower, and organized a group photo of people who happened to be there. All participants were informed in advance that there was no particular purpose to the group photo, so each individual was required to attach their own meaning to it. This work attempts to tackle the simple phenomenon of gathering, and as the people captured in this photo are complete strangers to each other, we are bidden to ask in which domain may we use such terms as“us” and “we”?
