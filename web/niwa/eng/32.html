<p>Replicating and Distributing the Key of My Home</p>
<p>2012 Performance Document Video 15’21min</p>
<p>Niwa orders a keysmith to duplicate his house key and then proceeds to give these copies to passing strangers on the street in Akihabara. His address is kept undisclosed, permitting his house keys to be distributed to the public, while the owner and purpose of the key remains unidentified. By creating the situation in which “his house key is always kept in the hands of a third person”, Niwa tries to demonstrate the realistic impossibility of solidarity and communion with others.</p>
