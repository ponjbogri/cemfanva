Publishing a Collection of Work in 36 Different Languages 

2012 Project 
 
Here all of Niwa’s projects since 2004 have been collated together, translated into 36 languages and published as a book. Essentially language is a tool invented in order to communicate one’s will within a specific area, but in the accelerated globalization of contemporary society, in the case of many advanced countries, English though supposedly a foreign language has become the common language.The artificial languages of Esperanto etc. were invented in a form of opposition to this hegemony of globalism, aiming to form a universal language which could be claimed by no one particular country. In this catalogue of work the contents has been translated into 36 randomly chosen languages from amongst the countless number of languages across the globe. As the reader is supplied with many more languages than necessary, this testimony of a world which spreads before us in endless translation provides a response to the imaginary identity which we cling to.
