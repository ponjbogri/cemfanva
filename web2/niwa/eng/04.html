<p>Shaking Hands with 100 Cats in Norway</p>
<p>2007 Video 15â€™06min</p>
<p>In the Norwegian city of Stavanger Niwa attempts to shake hands with 100 cats. Through the exchange between humans and cats, who are unable to understand each others language, there may be found significant meaning within a very trivial meeting. This video documentary records the pursuit of cats around this port town in conditions below freezing in the middle of winter. Produced in a residency at TOAH residency of TOU SCENE centre for contemporary art, Norway</p>
