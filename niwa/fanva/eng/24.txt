でもね（de-mo-ne）Neon Sign  

2012 Neon Tube 400mm x 500mm 
 
At Niwa’s request the hand written phrase “de-m-one (in Japanese lettersでもね)” was produced as an original neon sign by a professional manufacturer. Here through the play on the Japanese language it is not clear whether the word implies “it’s a demo” or “but mind you…”, and this ambiguity indicates how the determination of meaning depends on one’s state of mind.
