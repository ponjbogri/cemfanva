<p>Looking for Vladimir Lenin at Moscow Apartment</p>
<p>2012 Project Document Video 26â€™14min and 150 objects that represent Vladimir Lenin</p>
<p>Despite the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 there still remain in many homes in Moscow, the images of Vladimir Lenin. Visiting to ordinary homes around Moscow, Niwa searched for portraits, photos, propaganda posters, newspaper articles, flags, badges and many other objects, collecting these materials and exhibiting them in the gallery. Searching homes in a manner which may be likened to the KGB, the dialogue and negotiation with ordinary citizens comes to depict the memory of the former Soviet Union within contemporary Russia.
