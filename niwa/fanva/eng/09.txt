Holding a Wedding at 2am at Night Under a Streetlight for My Friends Who Cannot Determine on Marriage 

2009 Photographic Print 1200mm x 1500mm 
 
This project emerged at a time when Niwaâ€™s close friends, who had long been together as a couple, could not bring their relationship to the point of marriage, leading Niwa to suggest that he would get them into wedding dress and tuxedo and take a wedding photo for them instead. As Niwa had no further words for them, it became a work which engaged a questioning of how he might relate to this couple. Once this work was completed the two in fact became engaged.
