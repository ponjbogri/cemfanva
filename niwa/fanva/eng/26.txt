Depositing All the Money in My Pocket on the Street  
2012 Project Document Video 7'20min 
 
Niwa randomly places his small change in the vending machines which unsystematically dot the streets and walks away without buying anything. The value of the money remains shown on the vending machine display until it is found by someone. No one can tell if it will enter someoneâ€™s ownership or if it will be reported as lost-and-found after that. 
By temporarily removing himself from the highly systematized act of consumption, Niwa produces money of unknown ownership.
