Transforming Puddle A to Puddle B 
2004 Performance Video 10’53min

A performance held on the site where the Berlin wall once stood, in which Niwa moves one puddle to another, by means of carrying the water in his mouth. Questioning what he, as a Japanese artist, may do in response to the issue of the former East West divide, the Berlin wall and the cold war, Niwa’s answer was to transfer a puddle from former East Berlin to former West Berlin. The reality of the past impossibility of moving from one side to the other of the wall which once stood here is not something to eradicate but something which is to be remembered. Following this Niwa undertook the same performance in numerous places around the world.
